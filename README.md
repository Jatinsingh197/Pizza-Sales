Sales Dashboard
Recommended Structure and Order
1. 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis
This project analyzes pizza sales data to uncover key business insights. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights:

* Top-Selling Pizzas – Identify the most popular menu items.
* Revenue Leaders – Determine which pizzas generate the most sales.
* Peak Ordering Times – Discover when customers place the most orders (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
* Weekly & Daily Trends – Spot patterns in customer demand.
* Hot-Selling Categories – Find the most in-demand pizza categories.
  
2. What this is doing
The Pizza Sales Dashboard in Power BI provides insights into sales trends, including top-selling pizzas, highest revenue generators, peak order times, and best-performing days. It uses cleaned and modeled data with DAX measures to create interactive visuals, helping businesses make data-driven decisions.

4. Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.
